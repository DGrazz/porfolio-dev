      My name is <strong>Mario Garcia</strong>, but my friends call me DGrazz.
      I've always set myself apart from others with my <strong
        >entrepreneurial mindset</strong
      >
      and my <strong>obsession</strong> and need to <strong
        >be the best at everything I do</strong
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>I started in the world of IT at the age of 12</strong> by learning
      to use Photoshop. I uploaded the design process to YouTube, so I also <strong
        >end up designing for people</strong
      >
      who asked me to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, I decided to pursue a higher education degree in IT and
      specialize in front-end web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to this day, I continue to learn and improve my programming skills
      with <strong>useful projects that solve problems</strong>.
